About the extension
-------------------
CodeBurner is a Firefox add-on that integrates with Firebug, to extend it with reference material for HTML and CSS.

The extension's core functionality is centered around a new Reference panel, which contains a search tool for looking up HTML elements, attributes, and CSS properties.

The extension also hooks into context-menus in the HTML and CSS panels, the DOM crumbtrail, and the Inspector, adding options to look up a selected item (ie. search for it in the Reference panel) or to view a code example.

About this repository
---------------------

The Code Burner extension hosted on addons.mozilla.org does not support the last versions of Firebug anymore.

So this work tries to fix issues related to the compatibility of the CodeBurner extension with Firebug 1.12 and higher.

*No enhancement is planned for now, so please, do not fill an issue to request a feature.* However, bug reports are welcome.
